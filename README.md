# A-client-for-Discord-for-3DS
Applications that can use discord on 3DS

In order to build this homebrew, you'll need the following requirements:
* devkitARM (included in devkitPro)
* ctrulib (included in devkitARM)
* [3ds portlibs](https://github.com/Cruel/3ds_portlibs)
* [sf2dlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sf2dlib)
* [sfillib](https://github.com/xerpi/sfillib)
* [sftdlib](https://github.com/xerpi/sftdlib)  
Once you have installed these, a simple `make` should compile it. If you have FBI installed on your 3ds, and python installed on your computer, open FBI and go to `Remote install` -> `Recieve URLs over the network`.
 On your computer, type `make spunch`. This should install the CIA directly on your 3DS!
